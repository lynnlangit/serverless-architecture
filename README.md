This Repo is a companion area to my LinkedIn Learning [`Serverless Architecture`](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/serverless-architecture) course.   
- Serverless core concept (functions vs. VMs) is shown above (image from AWS documentation).
- NOTE: ***I am currenlty revising and updating this course (update to be published in late 2023)***

## Open Source Frameworks, Tools and Examples

Many open source resources show AWS examples, but could be implemented on GCP or Azure with some modifications.
